# Assignments for Cryptography I by Stanford University

The programming assignments for Coursera Cryptography I by Stanford University.

### Week 1: [Many Time Pad][week-1]

Let us see what goes wrong when a stream cipher key is used more than once. Given ciphertexts encrypted with the same stream cipher key, our goal is to decrypt the target ciphertext to get the secret message.

### Week 2: [AES in CBC and CTR modes][week-2]

Implement two encryption/decryption systems, one using AES in CBC mode and another using AES in counter mode (CTR). Given pairs of AES key and ciphertext, our goal is to recover the plaintext.

### Week 3: [File Authentication System with SHA256][week-3]

Our goal in this project is to build a file authentication system that lets browsers authenticate and play video chunks as they are downloaded without having to wait for the entire file.

### Week 4: [Padding Oracle Attack][week-4]

Let's experiment with a padding oracle attack against a toy website. Knowing that the website is vulnerable to a CBC padding oracle attack, our goal is to decrypt the ciphertext in the sample intercepted URL.

### Week 5: [Meet-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM) on Discrete Log][week-5]

Our goal is to write a program to compute discrete log modulo a prime _p_. In this project, we'll implement an algorithm that runs in time roughly âˆš2^40 = 2^20 using a meet-in-the-middle attack.

### Week 6: [RSA Problem][week-6]

Our goal in this project is to break RSA when the public modulus N is generated incorrectly. If the primes _p_ and _q_ are close to each other, _N = pq_ can be easily factored.
